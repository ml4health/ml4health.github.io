Extended Abstract,1,Towards Diagnosing Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease with Abdominal MRI Data using Deep Learning,"Arvind Pillai, Emmette Hutchison, Kamen Bliznashki, Chanchal Kumar, Sven Moosmang, Benjamin Challis, Mishal Patel","AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca",3,42,Afternoon,"Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a disease of increasing prevalence with invasive and high patient-burden diagnostics. Inspired by recent advances in machine learning digital diagnostics, we explored the efficacy of training a neural network to classify NAFLD v non-NAFLD patients in the UK Biobank dataset. We compared the performance of several ResNet-derived architectures in the context of whole abdomen, segmented liver and abdomen sans-liver. Non-local ResNet trained on whole abdomen MRI data yielded the highest precision (0.88 for NAFLD) and F1 (0.89 for NAFLD). This work opens the possibility for using a non-invasive deep learning-based diagnostic for NAFLD. Additionally, a larger cohort of patients with liver MRI data can now be labeled to explore UK Biobank data for additional clinical and genomic diagnostic features.

However, biomarkers may contain confounds that obfuscate useful information, thus impairing our ability to discern underlying causes and characteristics of ASD. Here, we explore multiple ways in which an adversarial factor model can be used to create confound-free biomarkers for ASD diagnosis by enforcing a degree of orthogonality to the confounding information contained in our biomarkers. First, we demonstrate that this adversarial model can be used to disentangle information related to a common comorbid disorder in intellectual disability from our biomarkers, thereby ensuring that our biomarkers inform only on ASD. Second, we use the same adversarial model to disentangle behavioral information from our neural biomarkers. This ensures our neural biomarkers inform primarily on underlying neurobiological characteristics of ASD and not concurrent behavior. Our methodology for creating confound-disentangled biomarkers is straightforward, flexible, and provides a template for future biomarker methods.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JDph2z_CjSKHLPg2yoX_7wkLeeFyAoKV/view?usp=sharing

Common healthcare scenarios are however often better described through multiple states, for example, the progress of a disease might be modeled as healthy, sick and dead instead of healthy and dead. Furthermore, individual characteristics can vary significantly between patients, resulting in idiosyncratic hazard rates and different disease trajectories, for which current standard models are often ill-suited. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of neural ordinary differential equations as a flexible and general method for estimating multi-state survival models by directly solving their representation through Kolmogorov forward equations. We show that our model exhibits state-of-the-art performance on popular survival data sets and demonstrate its efficacy in a multi-state setting.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GSe9uWwPsCLbI4vzY5Qc9cNiB6JIxj--

Recent work to build trust has centered on model interpretability methods to understand how a model reached a prediction. In this paper, we present complementary work aimed at providing domain experts a logical domain-relevant argument, or supporting evidence, as to why a prediction should be trusted. Such supporting evidence could improve a clinician's trust in the model and could be used with predictions to guide clinical decision making.
Focusing on the problem of clinical risk stratification, we first design a probabilistic model that relates meaningful latent concepts to both prediction targets and observed data. Inference in this probabilistic model then corresponds to both making a prediction \textit{and} providing domain-relevant support for that prediction. We present a two-step learning process to approximate inference and learn a predictive model that outputs both a prediction and supporting evidence. In experiments to predict mortality risk for cardiovascular patients from electrocardiogram and tabular data, we show that our approach provides insightful domain relevant supporting evidence for predictions with no sacrifice in model performance.",5:15 - 6:15 pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bocU563WcUjw-qIGbiRTjzUK499nD5H8

We focus on time to diagnosis (TTD) by conducting two large-scale, complementary analyses among men and women across 29 phenotypes and 195K patients. We first find that women are consistently more likely to experience a longer TTD than men, even when presenting with the same conditions. We further explore how TTD disparities affect diagnostic performance between genders, both across and persistent to time, by evaluating gender-agnostic disease classifiers across increasing diagnostic information. In both fairness analyses, the diagnostic process favors men over women, contradicting the previous observation that women may demonstrate relevant symptoms earlier than men. These analyses suggest that TTD is an important yet complex aspect when studying gender disparities, and warrants further investigation.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m0q0Rm7oo0lcmB7fIc2MZjG10jsv_5bS

Such requirements make it challenging to train qualified translators and costly to generate high-quality translations. Machine translation represents an effective alternative, but accurate machine translation requires large amounts of in- domain data. While such datasets are abundant in domains such as newswire, they are less accessible in the biomedical domain. Chinese and English are two of the most widely spoken languages, yet to our knowledge, a parallel corpus in the biomedical domain does not exist for this language pair. We develop an effective pipeline to acquire and process an English-Chinese parallel corpus, consisting of about 100,000 sentence pairs and 3,000,000 tokens on each side, from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

Most of such studies only consider the presence or absence of genetic variations but ignore their biological contextual information. In this study, we propose MTB-HINE-BERT to predict drug resistance of TB bacteria. This framework includes (1) a Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding (HINE) model specially designed for integrating biological contextual information of genetic variants, and (2) a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) without position embedding. The experiment results show that our model achieved the highest prediction accuracy compared with several advanced machine learning models.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R1xoFtfgj4xZdWT6A4wYwUqOvvLqqy24
Extended Abstract,275,Stable predictions for health related anticausal prediction tasks affected by selection biases: the need to deconfound the test set features,"Elias Chaibub Neto, Phil Snyder, Solveig K Sieberts, Larsson Omberg",Sage Bionetworks,2,30,Morning,"In health related machine learning applications, the training data often corresponds to a non-representative sample from the target populations where the learners will be deployed. In anticausal prediction tasks, selection biases often make the associations between confounders and the outcome variable unstable across different target environments. As a consequence, the predictions from confounded learners are often unstable, and might fail to generalize in shifted test environments. Stable prediction approaches aim to solve this problem by producing predictions that are stable across unknown test environments. These approaches, however, are sometimes applied to the training data alone with the hope that training an unconfounded model will be enough to generate stable predictions in shifted test sets. Here, we show that this is insufficient, and that improved stability can be achieved by deconfounding the test set features as well. We illustrate these observations using both synthetic data and real world data from a mobile health study.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XBmcZhula6DqXuuk8rRlAjntr37wGLAs

Robinson","Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London; Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry, University College London; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London",2,35,Morning,"Hierarchical model fitting has become commonplace for case-control studies of cognition and behaviour in mental health. However, these techniques require us to formalise assumptions about the data-generating process at the group level, which may not be known. Specifically, researchers typically must choose whether to assume all subjects are drawn from a common population, or to model them as deriving from separate populations. These assumptions have profound implications for computational psychiatry, as they affect the resulting inference (latent parameter recovery) and may conflate or mask true group-level differences. 

To test these assumptions we ran systematic simulations on synthetic multi-group behavioural data from a commonly used multi-armed bandit task (reinforcement learning task). We then examined recovery of group differences in latent parameter space under the two commonly used generative modelling assumptions: (1) modelling groups under a common shared group-level prior (assuming all participants are generated from a common distribution, and are likely to share common characteristics); (2) modelling separate groups based on symptomatology or diagnostic labels, resulting in separate group-level priors. 

We evaluated the robustness of these approaches to variations in data quality and prior specifications on a variety of metrics. We found that fitting groups separately (assumptions 2), provided the most accurate and robust inference across all conditions. Our results suggest that when dealing with data from multiple clinical groups, researchers should analyse patient and control groups separately as it provides the most accurate and robust recovery of the parameters of interest.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oOk3IuSfBo4CmhEY9ONhRmBdAoJ5FSnd

The diversity of symptoms and immune pathways expressed in SLE patients causes difficulties in treating SLE as well as in new clinical trials.

The dimensionality of the gene expression data was reduced by three separate methods (PCA, UMAP, and a simple linear autoencoder) and the results from each of these methods were used to separate patients into six clusters with k-means clustering. The clusters revealed three separate immune pathways in the SLE patients that caused SLE. These pathways were: (1) high interferon levels, (2) high autoantibody levels, and (3) dysregulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The first two pathways have been extensively studied in SLE. However, mitochondrial apoptosis has not been investigated before to the best of our knowledge as a standalone cause of SLE, independent of autoantibody production, indicating that mitochondrial proteins could lead to a new set of therapeutic targets for SLE in future research.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B-4-I4axFdHpHZgrpEBaAeDlADpK2wGd
