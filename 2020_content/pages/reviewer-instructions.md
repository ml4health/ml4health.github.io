### Goals for Reviewing Process

Similar to last year,  we will have two tracks at the ML4H workshop: a formal proceedings track for polished work with technical sophistication and clear healthcare impact as well as an extended abstract track for non-traditional research artifacts. Our goal in providing two tracks is to establish ML4H as a strong venue for publishing excellent ML4H work while also providing a forum for insightful discussion of creative and probing ideas.

A final but crucial goal is to give good feedback. Please do more than just give a numerical score! Be sure to list positive aspects of the paper, as well as a few constructive things the authors could improve for either a camera ready version (if accepted) or for resubmission elsewhere (if rejected).

### What counts as a good ML4H Paper/Abstract?

All reviewers should refer to the guidelines on [how to write a good ML4H paper or extended abstract](https://ml4health.github.io/2020/pages/writing-guidelines.html). The criteria for the proceedings and abstracts tracks are distinct -- while both tracks require high quality submissions, the abstract submissions should also be judged on their likelihood to lead to a good discussion at the workshop. Please refer to the writing guidelines document for exemplary submissions in each track.

### When should a paper switch to the abstract track? 

Works submitted to the Proceedings track can be considered for consideration to the extended abstract track. If you are reviewing a paper and think that a shortened 4-page version of the work would be strong enough to warrant consideration in the extended abstract track, make sure to select that option in the reviewer form on HotCRP.

Keep in mind that the primary goal of the extended abstract track is to generate productive and interesting discussion amongst conference attendees. Creative, insightful, and/or potentially divisive contributions (even if less fully developed or not performant) make great additions to the abstract track.  As a result, an extended abstract may not necessarily meet the same level of technical sophistication as a paper, as long as it meets the criteria of generating productive / interesting discussions.

### Confidentiality Guidelines

ML4H 2020 is adopting the same confidentiality guidelines as the main NeurIPS conference. Importantly, all aspects of the review process should be confidential. Do not discuss the submissions or reviews or use any ideas from the submissions in your own work until they are publicly available.

### Conflict Guidelines

Please check ASAP that your assigned papers do not represent conflicts of interest. You should not recognize any paper you are reviewing as work done by someone you work closely with.

If you find a conflict, report it immediately via email: <ml4h.workshop.neurips.2020@gmail.com>

### Anonymity Guidelines

Papers should be anonymous. If you find a major violation, please report it to the organizers: ml4h.workshop.neurips.2020@gmail.com.

Our process is double-blind. The authors do not know the reviewers' identities, and the reviewers do not know the authors' identities.  Of course, no process is perfect: the reviewers might be able to guess the authors' identities based on the data set or the approaches used, or by technical reports posted on the internet.  As a reviewer, we expect you will not actively attempt to discover the identity of the author.  We also caution you against assuming that you've discovered an author's identity based on a data set or approach: multiple independent invention is common, and different groups often share data sets. 

### Formatting Guidelines

Proceedings track papers should have their main content limited to 9 pages (including figures and text, but excluding references), and extended abstracts should be limited to 4 pages. Both submissions should use the two-column, PMLR, style file. See our [official instructions](https://ml4health.github.io/2020/pages/call-for-participation.html).

Please note that:

-   Papers (abstracts) with references that go beyond 9 (4) pages are allowed.

-   Papers (abstracts) with appendices that go beyond 9 (4) pages are allowed. However, reviewers should not feel obligated to read any supplementary material. Your time is precious!

-   Papers that do not use the PMLR style, but otherwise have content within page limit that could easily be made into the right format, are probably OK.

In general, we'd rather accept good work than nitpick about little formatting issues (especially because some clinicians may not be familiar with LaTeX). But big issues (e.g. a 20 page journal-like paper) would be grounds for rejection.

### How many reviews?

We've tried our best to grow a large pool of reviewers, so that each reviewer will be assigned no more than 5 submissions. Please help us keep this number small by completing your assigned reviews on time -- and if you can complete them early, all the better!

### How are papers assigned?

Authors labeled each paper with a set of topic areas, and each reviewer was asked to list their topic areas of expertise. These topic areas were used to assign reviewers to the most relevant papers possible.

Our reviewers all have expertise in both ML and healthcare applications. We used prior reviewing experience as well as training level to pair less experienced reviewers with more experienced reviewers.

### FAQ

-   Can PC members also be authors of papers or extended abstracts?

Yes. Though of course a PC member will not be assigned to review their own papers. That's a conflict of interest.

-   What if I don't have sufficient expertise to review a paper assigned to me?

While papers should provide adequate background that nearly all reviewers can provide a reasonable review, we understand that occasionally a paper may fall far outside your area of expertise. If this happens, please contact ml4h.workshop.neurips.2020@gmail.com immediately.
