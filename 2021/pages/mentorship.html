<h2>Submission Mentorship Program</h2>
    <p> The <b> Submission Mentorship Program </b> focuses on pairing less experienced authors with senior researchers to provide feedback on their paper submission, with the overall goal of improving submission quality and fostering future collaboration. Note that the mentors will not discuss possible paper ideas with the mentees, and hence, the mentees who do not already have a paper idea should not participate in this program. Further, authors who do not intend to submit a paper to ML4H2021 should not participate in this program. </p>
<p> We especially encourage less experienced authors and participants from underrepresented groups to sign up as mentees, as well as senior community members to serve as mentors for these programs. </p>
<p> The Submission Mentorship Program organized by the ML4H 2021 has 2 stages which you can apply for, as outlined next.</p>

<h5>Stage 1</h5>
    <p> This stage involves <b> 2.5 months </b> of mentorship. It is for mentees who would like to get feedback on the direction of the design, experiments, and results for a work they plan to submit to ML4H 2021. Specifically, the mentors will give suggestions for improvements to models and experiments as well as results analysis/presentation and paper organizations. <b> Mentors and mentees who are interested in this stage should fill in the corresponding application form below by July 3rd. </b> </p>
    <p> The mentors and mentees are encouraged to have a bi-weekly one-hour meeting to discuss the paper’s progress; i.e., the mentors and mentees will have approximately 5 one-hour meetings over <b> 10 weeks. </b> This allows both the mentor and mentee to work on the paper for a longer period of time. </p>
    <h6> Stage 1 Timeline </h6>
        <ol> 
          <li> July 5: Details about mentee-mentor pair-ups are sent out. </li>
          <li> July 5-9: Mentees are expected to initiate contact with their mentor and arrange an initial meeting. In this meeting, the mentees should discuss the paper’s idea and outline with the mentors as well as the plan (dates, format, expectations, etc) for their bi-weekly meetings. </li>
          <li> July 9 - Sep 10: The <b> mentors and mentees will meet on a bi-weekly basis </b> to work on the paper. After each meeting, the mentees are expected to incorporate the mentors’ feedback and send an updated draft of the paper to the mentors. </li>
          <li> Sept 13th: ML4H Submission deadline. </li>
        </ol>

<h5>Stage 2</h5>
  <p> This stage involves <b> 1.5 months </b> of mentorship. It allows mentees to get feedback on a complete draft, and it is more suitable and helpful for people who would like to get feedback from an experienced mentor to enhance the quality of a paper that they plan to submit to ML4H2021.  <b> Mentors and  mentees who are interested in this stage should complete the corresponding form below by August 3rd. </b> </p>
  <h6> Stage 2 Timeline </h6>
        <ol>
          <li> Aug 5: Details about mentee-mentor pair-ups are sent out. </li>
          <li> Aug 5-9: Mentees are expected to initiate contact with their mentor and arrange an initial meeting. Then, the mentees should send a submission / outline draft to their mentor within 1 week of your initial meeting.  </li>
          <li> Aug 14-27: Mentor provides feedback to mentee on the submission draft in a subsequent meeting. </li>
          <li> Aug 27 - Sep 3: Mentees incorporate the mentor’s feedback and send an updated paper to the mentor. </li>
          <li> Sep 3-9: Mentors provide final feedback prior to the ML4H submission deadline on 13th September 2021. </li>
        </ol>
 
<p> Mentors and mentees will be matched at random based on your shared research areas. The matching process between mentors and mentees will start July 3rd for Stage 1 and August 3rd for Stage 2. </p>
    
<h5>Application forms</h5>

<h2> Reviewer Mentorship Program </h2>
<p> The purpose of the reviewer mentorship program is to train junior reviewers, foster new connections and relationships in the ML4H community, and ultimately improve the quality of the review process. The primary expectations of the program are that (1) mentors will provide feedback to mentees on drafts of their reviews and (2) mentees will update their reviews on the basis of that feedback. </p>
    
<p> If you are interested in participating in the reviewer mentorship program as a mentor/mentee please sign up using the following <a href="https://forms.gle/YvDVfhFa1CSTGxVr8">form</a> </p>

    <p> <b> Deadline: </b> September 10th AoE, 2021. </p>

<h3>
  Structuring the feedback session
</h3>
<p> Mentors are free to structure the feedback session in whichever way they prefer. It is expected that mentors will read their mentees assigned papers and reviews and formulate their feedback prior to the feedback session with their mentee. However, the role of the mentor is not to serve as an additional reviewer on their mentee’s papers. Rather, the mentor should provide feedback to ensure that reviews are high-quality, constructive, and fair. To help facilitate that process, resources on what constitutes a high-quality review have been provided below. </p>

    <!-- <h5>Expectations</h5>
<h6>Mentees</h6>
<p>Mentees are expected to initiate contact with the assigned mentor and send a submittable draft of the paper/extended abstract to the mentor at least 2 weeks before the submission deadline. Moreover, the mentees are expected to take into account the feedback from the mentors and make a submission to the workshop by the Oct 2nd deadline. </p>
<h6>Mentors</h6>
<p>Mentors are expected to provide feedback on the draft received from the mentees at least 1 week before the submission deadline. We expect mentors to commit at least 4-5 hours for the mentorship program. </p>
<h6>Joint expectations</h6>
<ul>
<li>We strongly encourage the mentors and mentees to have at least two video or audio calls before the submission deadline: <ul>
<li>An initial call where the mentor and mentee discuss the core idea of the submission, relevant related work, and how it fits within the machine learning for health application. We also encourage the mentee to highlight what kind of feedback they would find most valuable on their submission draft (e.g. feedback on the presentation, technical details, evaluation set-up, etc.). </li>
<li>A subsequent call where the mentor delivers the feedback on the submission draft sent by the mentee. We will provide the mentors with a list of suggestions for feedback that could improve the submission of the mentee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the mentor and mentee are also strongly encouraged to examine the following document about how to write an excellent ML4H paper or extended abstract: <a href="https://ml4health.github.io/2020/pages/writing-guidelines.html">https://ml4health.github.io/2020/pages/writing-guidelines.html</a>. This document will also be used to communicate to reviewers what features of submissions are most important to the ML4H venue. </p>
<p>Additional resources and guidelines will be provided to the mentors and mentees after the pairing up has been completed. If you have any questions, please contact <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#105;&#111;&#97;&#110;&#97;&#46;&#98;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#64;&#101;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#111;&#120;&#46;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#105;&#111;&#97;&#110;&#97;&#46;&#98;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#64;&#101;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#111;&#120;&#46;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a>. </p>
