[{"UID":"A6","abstract":"Electrocardiography (ECG) is an effective and non-invasive diagnostic tool that measures the electrical activity of the heart. Interpretation of ECG signals to detect various abnormalities is a challenging task that requires expertise. Recently, the use of deep neural networks for ECG classification to aid medical practitioners has become popular, but their black box nature hampers clinical implementation. Several saliency-based interpretability techniques have been proposed, but they only indicate the location of important features and not the actual features. We present a novel interpretability technique called qLST, a query-based latent space traversal technique that is able to provide explanations for any ECG classification model. With qLST, we train a neural network that learns to traverse in the latent space of a variational autoencoder trained on a large university hospital dataset with over 800,000 ECGs annotated for 28 diseases. We demonstrate through experiments that we can explain different black box classifiers by generating ECGs through these traversals.","authors":"Melle B. Vessies*, Sharvaree P.

Algorithms that learn robust models by estimating invariant properties across time periods for domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation might be suitable to proactively mitigate dataset shift. In this study, we characterized the impact of temporal dataset shift on clinical prediction models learned from electronic health records and evaluated domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms on improving model robustness compared with the standard empirical risk minimization. Intensive care unit patients from the MIMIC-IV database were categorized by year groups (2008\u00d02010,2011\u00d02013, 2014\u00d02016 and 2017\u00d02019). Feed-forward neural networks were trained using empirical risk minimization as well as variants of domain generalization and adaptation to predict mortality, long length of stay, sepsis, and invasive ventilation. We observed heterogeneity in the impact of temporal dataset shift across clinical prediction tasks, with the worst impact observed in sepsis prediction. When compared with empirical risk minimization, domain generalization and adaptation algorithms failed to produce more robust models. These findings highlight the difficulty of improving robustness to dataset shift with purely data-driven techniques that do not leverage prior knowledge of the nature of the shift and a need for alternate approaches to preserve model performance overtime in clinical medicine.","authors":"Lin Lawrence Guo, Stephen R Pfohl, Jason Fries, Alistair Johnson, Jose Posada, Catherine Aftandilian, Nigam Shah, Lillian Sung","chat_active":"","code_link":"","keywords":"robustness, ehr","paper_link":"","poster_link":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zTUYSU-bKIWpcMCnDBR6e7ZMjkanjOxK","presentation_link":"","title":"Evaluation of Domain Generalization and Adaptation on Improving Model Robustness to Temporal Dataset Shift in Clinical Medicine"},{"UID":"A4","abstract":"This work aims to understand the impact of class imbalance on the performance of chest x-ray classifiers, in light of the standard evaluation practices adopted by researchers in terms of discrimination and calibration performance.

Secondly, we perform a systematic experiment on two major chest x-ray datasets to explore the behavior of several performance metrics under different class ratios and show that widely adopted metrics can conceal the performance in the minority class. Finally, we propose the adoption of two alternative metrics, the precision-recall curve and the Balanced Brier score, which better reflect the performance of the system in such scenarios. Our results indicate that current evaluation practices adopted by the research community for chest x-ray classifiers may not reflect the performance of such systems for computer aided diagnosis in real clinical scenarios, and suggest alternatives to improve this situation.","authors":"Candelaria Mosquera, Luciana Ferrer, Diego H.

Modern pre-trained NLP models such as PEGASUS have emerged as capable alternatives to human summarization, reaching state-of-the-art performance on many summarization benchmarks.

The prevalence of different networks during resting state periods provide useful features for predicting the trajectory of neurodegenerative diseases. Techniques for network estimation rely on statistical correlation or dependence between voxels. Due to the large number of voxels, rather than consider the voxel-to-voxel correlations between all voxels, a small set of seed voxels are chosen. Consequently, the network identification may depend on the selected seeds. As an alternative, we propose to fit first-order linear models with sparse priors on the coefficients to model activity across the entire set of cortical grey matter voxels as a linear combination of a smaller subset of voxels. We propose a two-stage algorithm for voxel subset selection that uses different sparsity-inducing regularization approaches to identify subject-specific causally predictive voxels. To reveal the functional networks among these voxels, we then apply independent component analysis (ICA) to model these voxels' signals as a mixture of latent sources each defining a functional network. Based on the inter-subject similarity of the sources' spatial patterns we identify independent sources that are well-matched across subjects but fail to match the independent sources from a group-based ICA. These are resting state networks, common across subjects that group ICA does not reveal.

As a secondary contribution, we enhance existing open source datasets and provide two uniformly processed, cross-organism, homologue gene-matched datasets to the community.","authors":"Odhran O'Donoghue, Paul Duckworth, Giuseppe Ughi, Linus Scheibenreif, Kia Khezeli, Adrienne Hoarfrost, Samuel Budd, Patrick Foley, Nicholas Chia, John Kalantari, Graham Mackintosh, Frank Soboczenski, Lauren Sanders","chat_active":"","code_link":"","keywords":"causality, robustness","paper_link":"","poster_link":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MRaTUcupQSZ-6n9OT-pNNAn2JK7FDtzo","presentation_link":"","title":"Invariant Risk Minimisation for Cross-Organism Inference: Substituting Mouse Data for Human Data in Human Risk Factor Discovery"},{"UID":"D1","abstract":"Dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive decline and affects more than 50 million people worldwide. Dementia is under-diagnosed by healthcare professionals - only one in four people who suffer from dementia are diagnosed. Even when a diagnosis is made, it may not be entered as a structured International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code in a patient's charts. Information relevant to cognitive impairment (CI) is often found within electronic health records (EHR), but manual review of clinician notes by experts is both time consuming and often prone to errors. Automated mining of these notes presents an opportunity to label patients with cognitive impairment in EHR data. We developed natural language processing (NLP) tools to identify patients with cognitive impairment and demonstrate that linguistic context enhances performance for the cognitive impairment classification task. We fine-tuned our attention based deep learning model, which can learn from complex language structures, and substantially improved accuracy (0.93) relative to a baseline NLP model (0.84). Further, we show that deep learning NLP can successfully identify dementia patients without dementia-related ICD codes or medications.","authors":"Tanish Tyagi*, Colin G.

Despite a growing number of uncertainty quantification techniques, there is a lack of evaluation guidelines on how to select OOD detection methods in practice. This gap impedes implementation of OOD detection methods for real-world applications. Here, we propose a series of practical considerations and tests to choose the best OOD detector for a specific medical dataset. These guidelines are illustrated on a real-life use case of Electronic Health Records (EHR). Our results can serve as a guide for implementation of OOD detection methods in clinical practice, mitigating risks associated with the use of machine learning models in healthcare.","authors":"Karina Zadorozhny, Patrick Thoral, Paul Elbers, Giovanni Cin\u00e0","chat_active":"","code_link":"","keywords":"uncertainty, robustness, ehr","paper_link":"","poster_link":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Pe6bpjrVSQnGTC0yIhoDL7a8Np5HCBkv","presentation_link":"","title":"Out-of-Distribution Detection for Medical Applications: Guidelines for Practical Evaluation"},{"UID":"B1","abstract":"The integration of artificial intelligence into clinical workflows requires reliable and robust models. Among the main features of robustness is repeatability. Much attention is given to classification performance without assessing the model repeatability, leading to the development of models that turn out to be unusable in practice. In this work, we evaluate the repeatability of four model types on images from the same patient that were acquired during the same visit. We study the performance of binary, multi-class, ordinal, and regression models on three medical image analysis tasks: cervical cancer screening, breast density estimation, and retinopathy of prematurity classification. Moreover, we assess the impact of sampling Monte Carlo dropout predictions at test time on classification performance and repeatability. Leveraging Monte Carlo predictions significantly increased repeatability for all tasks on the binary, multi-class, and ordinal models leading to an average reduction of the 95% limits of agreement by 17% points.","authors":"Andreanne Lemay, Katharina Hoebel, Christopher P.

Data plays a vital role in the development of ML-based healthcare systems that directly impact human lives. Many of the ethical issues with healthcare applications of ML can be traced back to structural inequalities that are reflected in the way we collect and process data. Developing a guideline for improving documentation practices in the creation, use and maintenance of ML healthcare datasets is of critical importance. In this work, we introduce Healthsheet, to address adaptations and expansions of the original datasheet questionnaire to healthcare-specific applications. We address the collection and use of sensitive attributes, dataset versioning and maintenance, privacy, data collection context, and health-related devices. As part of the development process of Healthsheet, we worked with three publicly-available healthcare datasets as our case studies, each with different types of structured data: Electronic Health Records (EHR), multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trial data and smartphone-based performance outcome measures.","authors":"Negar Rostamzadeh, Subhrajit Roy, Diana Mincu, Andrew Smart, Lauren Wilcox, Mahima Pushkarna, Razvan Amironesei, Jessica Schrouff, Madeleine Elish, Nyalleng Moorosi, Berk Ustun, Noah Broesti, Katherine Heller","chat_active":"","code_link":"","keywords":"fairness","paper_link":"","poster_link":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sc9z_w4Ej0cqPI_2ZAI50Uac_Cw3l68B","presentation_link":"","title":"Specialized Healthsheet for Healthcare Datasets"},{"UID":"E4","abstract":"Mechanical ventilation is one of the most widely used therapies in the ICU. However, despite broad application from anaesthesia to COVID-related life support, many injurious challenges remain. We frame these as a control problem: ventilators must let air in and out of the patient's lungs according to a prescribed trajectory of airway pressure. Industry-standard controllers, based on the PID method, are neither optimal nor robust. Our data-driven approach learns to control an invasive ventilator by training on a simulator itself trained on data collected from the ventilator. This method outperforms popular reinforcement learning algorithms and even controls the physical ventilator more accurately and robustly than PID. These results underscore how effective data-driven methodologies can be for invasive ventilation and suggest that more general forms of ventilation (e.g., non-invasive, adaptive) may also be amenable.","authors":"D.
