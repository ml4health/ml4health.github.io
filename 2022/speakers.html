<h3><a id="nicola"></a> Nicola Pezzotti</h3>
<!-- <p>Health disparities in the United States are one of the largest factors in reducing the health of the population. Disparities means some groups have lower life expectancy, are dying at higher rates from COVID-19, and utilize less mental health services, to name just a few examples. The future of medicine will be based on Artificial Intelligence and new technological platforms that promise to improve outcomes and reduce cost. Our role as AI researchers should be to ensure that these new technologies also reduce health disparities. In this talk I will describe recent work showing how we can work to reduce health disparities in the future of medicine. By ensuring that our task, datasets, algorithms and evaluations are equitable and representative of all types of patients, we can ensure that the research we develop will reduce health disparities.</p> -->
<p> Nicola Pezzotti is a Senior Scientist in Artificial Intelligence at Philips Research, Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and an assistant professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology. His research interests include machine learning, medical imaging, visual analytics, explainable AI, optimization techniques, and software engineering. He received his BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Brescia, Italy, in 2009 and 2011. He received his PhD cum Laude from Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, in 2018. Besides his experience in the startup world, he was a visiting scientist at INRIA Saclay, Paris, in 2017 and Google AI, Zurich, in 2018. He is the recipient of several awards, including the IEEE VGTC Best Dissertation Award, TU Delft Excellence in Research, and the Dirk Bartz Prize for Visual Computing in Medicine.</p>
